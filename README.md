## 1. Basic Tutorial
The tutorial begins by setting up the R environment and providing a brief overview of the functions and parameters associated with the diffusion model.
The functions introduced include `dwiener`, `pwiener`, `qwiener`, `rwiener`, `nlm`, and `optim`.
The parameters of the diffusion model discussed are Œ± (boundary separation), ùúè (non-decision time), Œ≤ (initial bias), and Œ¥ (drift rate parameter).
There's also a note on the Maximum likelihood estimation method using rWiener.


### 1.1 Defining Dataset and Parameters:

A dataset is generated using the rwiener function with 100 observations and parameters like boundary separation, non-decision time, bias, and drift rate.

### 1.2 d-Wiener-function:

This section demonstrates how to obtain the density of a specific quantile using the dwiener function.

### 1.3 p-Wiener function:

The tutorial explains how to calculate the cumulative distribution using the pwiener function.

### 1.4 q-Wiener function:

The inverse CDF function, qwiener, is introduced to find the appropriate quantile for a given probability.

### 1.5 Plot-function:

The wiener_plot function is used to visualize the observed lower and upper responses.

### 1.6 Model fitting:

The tutorial demonstrates how to fit the diffusion model to the data using optimization algorithms like Nelder-Mead and BFGS.
Comparing Model vs. Real Data:

The tutorial provides code to generate modeled data and compare it to real data using density plots.
### 1.7 Criteria:

This section introduces various criteria functions like `wiener_likelihood`, `wiener_deviance`, `wiener_aic`, and `wiener_bic` to evaluate the fit of the model.

### 1.8 Full Analysis Pipeline
The tutorial provides a comprehensive pipeline for analyzing the data:
- Pipeline Part 1: Parameter Estimation for each participant.
- Pipeline Part 2: Estimation parameters are extracted.
- Pipeline Part 3: Modeled data is generated.
- Pipeline Part 4: Modeled and real data are compared.
- Mean Parameters of Model vs. Real Data: The tutorial concludes by plotting the mean parameters of the model against the real data.

## 2. Advanced Tutorial

This tutorial, titled "ADVANCED_Tutorial", provides a comprehensive guide on advanced data analysis using the Drift Diffusion Model (DDM) in R. The tutorial is structured as follows:

### 2.1 Creating the Data
- Simulated data is generated for two groups (A and B) for multiple participants.
- Helper functions are defined to convert milliseconds to seconds and compute deleted trials.
- Results for deleted trials are printed.

### 2.2 RT-Distributions:

- Reaction time distributions are plotted for different conditions and groups.

### 2.4 DDM Fit:
- The data is preprocessed.
- The DDM is fit to the data for each participant.
- Results, including model coefficients and information criteria, are saved and printed.

### 2.5 Majority Vote for BIC, AIC, and Likelihood Ratio Test:

- The tutorial calculates the differences in BIC and AIC between the simple and complex models for each participant.
- Based on these differences, a majority vote is taken to decide the preferred model.

### 2.6 Plot the Data:

- The tutorial plots the beta and delta parameters for each reward type.

### 2.7 Statistics for the Group Levels:

- Paired t-tests are conducted for beta (bias) and delta (drift rate) between group levels.

### 2.8 Sanity Checks:

- __Sanity Check:__ Ensure that optimization routines meet a predefined criterion for convergence. Check that certain parameters (like Non-decision time and boundary separation) adhere to logical constraints.
- __Predictive Check:__ Validates the model by using parameter estimates to generate simulated datasets. The simulated data should resemble key features of the empirical data.
- __Parameter Recovery Study:__ After simulating data, the DDM is applied to see if the original parameters can be recovered.
